My Power BI project is focused on analyzing and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) for ShopNest Store to enhance business insights and drive better decision-making. The KPIs are:

Total Orders: Tracks the total number of customer orders placed, giving a clear view of demand and sales activity.

Total Sales: Represents the total revenue generated, allowing us to evaluate overall financial health and identify growth opportunities.

Month: Analyzes data by month to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and month-over-month performance changes.

Average Review Score: Measures customer satisfaction by calculating the average score from product and service reviews, highlighting areas for improvement.

Using these metrics, I create interactive dashboards and reports that provide actionable insights, such as understanding customer behavior, improving products, and optimizing sales strategies."
